# Machine Learning in Biology: Predicting Heart Failure based on Patient Medical History and Blood Chemistry

## Executive Summary

<ol>
	<li> <p align='justify'> We can use the Leave One Out Cross Validation method to handle datasets with small samples as the calculated test accuracies are more robust than the train-test split method </p> </li>

	<li> <p align='justify'> Application and interpretation of ML in a biological problem is highly context dependent. In this study, while I was able to create an ML model with an 85% accuracy (trained on data from Pakistani patients), applying this model to predict heart failures for non-Pakistani people should be handled with skepticism. There are some context changes on a molecular level that even traditional machine learning models might not account for. </p> </li>

	<li> <p align='justify'> The value that the ML model with 85% accuracy gives when we applied in a different context is that it can provide us with a base expectation of what can happen. The ML model is used to augment decision making but not replace the decision makers. </p> </li>
