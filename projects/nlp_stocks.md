## Abstract
<p align='justify'>
In this study, we are predicting the movement of daily stock returns in the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEi) using business news articles. We scraped business news articles from Rappler, encompassing news from 2015 to 2020 and we obtained the historical stock prices of the PSEi for the same period. Sentiment scores were assigned to the articles using the <i>gensim.summarization.keywords </i> module and the VADER model. These sentiment scores were then used as input to various machine learning models, with the goal of predicting the movement of stock 
returns with three-day delay, as either positive (+1) or negative (-1). Our best machine learning model is a Random Forest Classifier with a test accuracy of 65.46%. Overall, we developed a machine learning model that incorporates Natural Language Processing and the novel concept of “delayed results” via the 3-day delay prediction. End users can leverage our model to augment their decision making of buying, holding, or selling stocks given business news only
