## Abstract
<p align='justify'>
The hospitality industry is an essential part of travelling and tourism. As the hotel 
industryâ€™s market size grows, so is the rate of cancelled bookings and at one point this 
rate reached to as much as 40%. While cancellation of booking is inevitable due to 
unforeseen circumstances, there is merit in trying to reduce the cancellation rate. The 
group is trying to determine the factors that may lead to cancellation of bookings. We 
trained various classifier machine learning models to predict the cancellation status
using a hotel booking demand dataset that contains features like arrival date, daily rate
etc. The best model came out to be the Random Forest Classifier with a test accuracy 
of 86.16%. The Random Forest model identified the top 3 predictors as the Lead Time, 
Average Daily Rate, and the week number. To look deeper into the customer behavior, 
we plotted out a Decision Tree using the Decision Tree classifier model that predicts 
cancellation status with an 82.73% accuracy and identified 7 distinct customer 
personas with a high likelihood of booking cancellation. Our findings can help 
businesses through a potential system we designed where potential cancellations are
flagged and hotel management can tailor-fit mitigation strategies to avoid cancellation. 
Our findings can also help customers through insights they can use in managing their 
bookings behavior, like not booking way too advance and pushing through with 
requests as management identify those requests as commitments.
